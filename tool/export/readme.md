### Exports Git Repository

Since using the export command of Git will create an archive of unique file name, it will be a problem when installing the plugin on WordPress site.

This script will export the project files to a zip archive file from the latest commit.

### Usage
1. Rename `settings-sample.cfg` to `settings.cfg` and edit the values in the file for your needs.
2. Run `bash export.sh`.
