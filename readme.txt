== Description ==

= Display Amazon Associates Links with Minimal Effort = 

Still manually searching products and pasting affiliate links? What happens if the products get outdated? With this plugin, you do not have to worry about it nor trouble to do such repetitive tasks. Just pick categories which suit your site and it will automatically display the links of decent products just coming out from Amazon today.

The links are tagged with your Amazon Associate ID. The plugin supports 10 Amazon locales and works even on JavaScript disabled browsers. Insert the ads as widget or place generated shortcode or PHP code where the links should appear.

If you want to search a specific product, yes, you can do that too. If you are good at HTML and CSS coding and know a little about PHP, you can create your own template! That means you can design the layout.

Display affiliate links along with your posts with this plugin to generate actual income with minimal efforts.

= Supports All Amazon Associates Locales =
Includes Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, UK, US, Canada, France, Australia, India, China, Mexico and Brazil.

= Works without JavaScript =
Some visitors turn off JavaScript for security and most ads including Google Adsense will not show up to them. But this one works!

= Automatic Insertion in Posts and Feeds = 
Just check where you want the product links to appear with auto-insert. 

- **Static Contents Conversion** - If you want the product link to be static, it is possible. This means if you deactivate the plugin, the converted contents will remain.
- **Detailed Visibility Criteria** - You can enable/disable product links on the pages you want or do not want by post ID, taxonomy, page type, and post type. 

= Widgets = 
Place the widget in the sidebar and select the unit you created. The product links will appear in where you want. 

- **By Units** - choose the created units to display in the widget.
- **Contextual Search** - with this, you don't have to create a unit. It will automatically searches products relating to the currently displayed page contents.

= Shortcode and PHP Function = 
Insert the ads in specific posts and pages with the shortcode. If you want to insert in the theme template, use the PHP code the plugin provides to produce the outputs.

= Filter Unwanted Products = 
If there are some items you don't want to display, you can create a black and white list by description, title, and ASIN.

= Custom Buttons =
Visitors more likely click buttons than regular text hyper links. Define your custom buttons and insert it to the unit output. 

= Export Ads into External Sites with Feed = 
By subscribing to the product feed produced with the units you create as RSS or JSON, you can import them from other sites. 

If you have a web site that can display RSS feed contents, just create a WordPress site somewhere with this plugin and fetch the feed from the site. If you are an App developer, you can just display the items from the feed without programming an API client.

= Various Unit Options = 

- **Image Size** - The size of thumbnails can be specified. It supports up to 500 pixel large with a clean resolution.
- **Sort Order** - Shuffle the product links so that the visitor won't get bored as it gives refreshed impression.
- **URL cloaking** - You can obfuscate the link urls so it helps to prevent being blocked by browser Ad-blocking add-ons. 
- and more.

= Customize Outputs =
Besides the **Item Format** unit option which lets you design the output of a unit, you can create a custom template. This gives you freedom of customization and lets you achieve more advanced and detailed design.

= Unit Types =
- **Category** - pick your category that matches your site topic.
- **Product Search** - create a unit of a search result.
- **Item Look-up** - display specific products.
- **Similarity Look-up** - display similar products.
- **URL** - list items from an external web source.

= Getting Started =    
To get started, create a unit first and display it with widgets, shortcode, or auto-insert.

= Supported Language =
- English
- Japanese  
  
== Installation ==

= Install =
1. Upload **`amazon-auto-links.php`** and other files compressed in the zip folder to the **`/wp-content/plugins/`** directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Getting Started = 
1. Go to **Dashboard** -> **Amazon Auto Links** -> **Add Unit by Category**.
1. Configure the options and select categories.
1. After saving the unit option, go to **'Manage Units'** to get the shortcode or if you check one of the insert option, the links will automatically appear in posts or feeds depending on your choice. The widget is available in the **Appearance** -> **Widgets** page as well.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Do I need Amazon Associate ID to use this plug-in? =

Yes. Otherwise, you don't get any revenue. You can get it by signing up for [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/).  

= Do I need Amazon Access Keys? = 

For the *Category* and *Tag* unit types, no, you don't need them. However, for the *search* unit type, you need them as the plugin uses Amazon API.

However, for the *Search* unit type, and for some items such as `%image_set%` in the *Item Format* option, setting up API keys is required. 

To use the keys you need to have an account with [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html). The keys can be obtained by logging in to [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) and you need to get **Access Key ID** (public key) and **Secret Access Key** (private key).

More detailed instruction, refer to the [**How to Obtain Access Key and Secret Key**](http://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-auto-links/other_notes/) section.

= What does Unit mean? =

A unit is a set of rules that defines how Amazon products should be displayed.

When you display Amazon products, you would specify a unit and the plugin will generate outputs based on the rules defined for the unit.

= What would be the benefit to upgrade to the pro version? =

With the pro version, unlimited numbers of units can be created. Also the number of categories per unit, the number of items to display per unit are unrestriceted as well. Please consider upgrading it. [Amazon Auto Links Pro](http://en.michaeluno.jp/amazon-auto-links/amazon-auto-links-pro) As of Pro 2.0.6, links can be displayed in multiple columns.

= I get a blank white page after adding a unit to the theme. What is it? What should I do? =

It could be the allocated memory capacity for PHP reached the limit. One way to increase it is to add the following code in your wp-config.php or functions.php
`define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M' );`
The part, 128M, should be changed accordingly.

= I want to display product links horizontally in multiple columns. Is it possible? = 

Yes, with [Pro](http://en.michaeluno.jp/amazon-auto-links/amazon-auto-links-pro)! 

= I have a feature request. Would you implement that? = 
Post it in the [support section](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/amazon-auto-links). If it is feasible, it will be included in the to-do list in the Other Notes section.

= I get Amazon product links everywhere on the site after creating some units. How can I restrict them to certain pages? =
Go to `Dashboard` -> `Amazon Auto Links` -> `Manage Auto-insert`. There turn off unnecessary auto-insert items. You can edit their definitions and define where units should be displayed.

= My credentials do not seem to be authenticated. How can I check if my access keys are the correct ones? = 
Try [Scratchpad](http://webservices.amazon.com/scratchpad/) to make sure your keys work there as well.

= How to Create Own Template =

<h5><strong>Step 1</strong></h5>

Copy an existing template that is located in `...wp-content/plugins/amazon-auto-links/template` and rename the copied folder.

<h5><strong>Step 2</strong></h5>

Remove the files besides `style.css` and `template.php` as other files are optional.

<h5><strong>Step 3</strong></h5>
 
Edit `style.css` and `template.php` to customize the layout.

<h5><strong>Step 4</strong></h5>

Create a folder named `amazon-auto-links` in your theme's folder. If you are using Twenty Thirteen, the location would be `...wp-content\themes\twentythirteen\amazon-auto-links`.

<h5><strong>Step 5</strong></h5>

Move the working folder(the copied one) to it (the `amazon-auto-links` folder you just created).

<h5><strong>Step 6</strong></h5>

The plugin will automatically detect your template and add it in the template listing table. So activate it.

= Upgrading V1 to V2 = 
When upgrading v1 to v2, a few options will be lost. That includes:

* Sidebar widget 
* The positions of the inserting area

These options need to be reconfigured.

= How to Obtain Access Key and Secret Key =
For the search unit type, an access key and its secret key are required to perform API requests. 

We need to deal with additional two separate Amazon services apart from the Amazon Associates.

<h5><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a Product Advertising API Account</h5>
Before you create an access key, you have to make sure you have singed up with [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html).

<h5><strong>Step 2</strong> - Sign up with Amazon Web Service</h5>
Next, create an account with Amazon Web Service(http://aws.amazon.com/). At the top right pull-down menu, you can navigate to `My Account/Console` -> `Security Credential`.

<h5><strong>Step 3</strong> - Create an Access Key</h5>
In the [Security Credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) page, find the section named `Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)` and click on that.

Then press the `Create New Access Key` button to create a key. Don't forget to keep the secret access key as well. Amazon has changed the policy not to let the user to obtain the secret key later on.

Also note that at the point that an access key is issued, if you have not created an account with Product Advertising API, the key will be invalid. If that happens, delete the created access key and go back to the previous step.

You can check if your access key is valid or not with [Scratchpad](http://webservices.amazon.com/scratchpad/).
