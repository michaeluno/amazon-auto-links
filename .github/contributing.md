__Please Note:__ GitHub is basically for bug reports, technical discussions, and contributions only.

## Submitting a Ticket

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues):

- to report a problem by making sure:
    - the same issue has not been reported yet.
    - you clearly describe the issue including the ***steps*** to reproduce the bug. Unless the core contributors conform the behavior, it will not be fixed.
    - you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of WordPress and PHP you are using.

- to suggest ideas for enhancement.

***Do not post support requests***. If your post is considered as a support request, it will be labelled as so. Please use the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/admin-page-framework) to get helped.

## Adding and Submitting Changes

### Clone - Getting Core Files 

You would need to access the code of the core files to add modifications. The downloadable zip file does not include core files but the complied library files only.

In order to modify the framework development files, clone the repository files. 

#### Git
With Git, simply clone the repository from either of the following addresses.

##### ssh
```
git@github.com:michaeluno/admin-page-framework.git
```

##### https
```
https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework.git
```
    
#### [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
With Composer, create a `composer.json` file with the following contents and perform `php composer.phar install`.

```
{
    "require": {
        "michaeluno/admin-page-framework": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

### Making Changes to Your Cloned Repository

The core files are located in the [development](../development) directory. 

1. Make sure the constant `WP_DEBUG` is set to `true` in the `wp-config.php` file of your development site. If this is `false`, the loader plugin will load the complied files in the [library](../library) directory.
2. Modify the core files and make sure your changes take effect.
    - Ensure you stick to the [Admin Page Framework Coding Standards](./coding_standard.md).
3. If you add class files, make sure you run `run.sh` in `tool/inclusion_class_list` to generate inclusion file lists.
4. After all the modifications are done, run `run.sh` in `tool/beautifier` to compile the files.
  
### Requesting a Pull

- When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix.
- If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit/functional/acceptance tests for your changes.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the [dev](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/tree/dev) branch of the Admin Page Framework repository.
- At this point, you are waiting on us to merge your pull request. We will review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

## Code Documentation

* We ensure that every Admin Page Framework function is documented well and follows the standards set by phpDoc.
* An example function can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sunnyratilal/5308969).
* Please make sure that every function is documented so that when we update our API Documentation things don't go awry!
	* If you are adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`
* Finally, please use 4 spaces and not tabs for indentations.
