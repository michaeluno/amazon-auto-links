- Added the `Opt` checkbox in the `Restore Defaults` setting field.
- Fixed a bug that caused the PHP Fatal error, "Uncaught Error: Call to a member function get_page_permastruct() on null". 
- Fixed a bug that the component checkboxes did not take effect in the `Reset` screen and resulted in restoring all the settings.
